The "Give It a Go" Event Score Display System is designed to showcase scores achieved by customers at "give it a go" events and community fÃªtes. By displaying scores publicly, the system aims to create a sense of competition among participants, encouraging them to keep coming back and engaging with the event.

## Built With

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

As this web application is likely to be used offline, these can't be downloaded via http. As such, I have directly included the files in the `lib` directory. This means the application can be used without internet access.

To get started, clone or download the files from the GitHub repository. Open the file `index.html`.

1. Clone or download the repository from GitHub
    - Download as a ZIP file to your local machine and extract.

2. Navigate to the "About" page using the top navigation bar. On this page, information and an image slideshow related to the club is displayed. This can be displayed when customers enquire about the club, or simply during quieter times to advertise to passers by.

3. To add new scores to the leaderboard, navigate to the "Add Score" page. Fill in and submit the form. Upon submission, the page will redirect to the main scoreboard page. Newly submitted scores will flash blue for 3 seconds to make easy to see which score is the customers. Refreshing the page will cause the row to flash again if it is missed the first time.

4. Clicking on the club logo in the top left corner will open the club's website.
5. To access the database, follow <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>i</kbd> to access Chrome Developer Tools, then `Application` > `IndexedDB` > `archery_scores` > `scores`. This section can be used to modify entries if needed. Checking `Application` > `Session Storage` > `file://` will display the current `flashId`; the database ID primary key of the most recent entry. 
6. To *entirely* clear the database, `Application` > `IndexedDB` > `archery_scores` > `Delete database`. This will delete every entry!
